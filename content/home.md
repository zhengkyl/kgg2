# About KGG
We're an epic community of gamers dedicated to advocating for the world's most repressed minority group.

Kappa Gamma Gamma is officially an unofficial fraternity/sorority/community open and welcoming to all interested individuals. Originally founded in 2019 as a meme, KGG remains a joke-taken-slightly-too-seriously by an incredibly homosexual and overwhelmingly male group of gamers.
