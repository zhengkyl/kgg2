We're an epic community of gamers dedicated to advocating for the world's most repressed minority group.

Kappa Gamma Gamma is officially an unofficial fraternity/sorority/cooperative open and welcoming to all interested individuals. Learn about our Unspoken Rule and gaming opportunities at the 3rd floor of the Honors College North building.
